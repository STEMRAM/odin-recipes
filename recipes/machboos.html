        <li>2 TBSP Tomato Puree</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>3 Tomatoes (chopped small)</li>
        <li>1/2 a Bell Pepper (Green or Red) </li>
        <li>10g Coriander (Chopped finely) </li>
        <li>2 Green Chillies (optional) </li>
        <li>50g Blanched Almonds (optional) </li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Coat your saucepan with enough oil to cover the bottom. </li>
        <li>Add your onions and saut√© for around 5 minutes to sweat the onions and let them turn slightly brown on their edges. </li>
        <li>Once they are ready add in your garlic, spices,  and dried limes, stir well and fry for a following 2-4 mins, on a low to medium heat. </li>
        <li>Add in your tomato puree, stir through. </li>
        <li>Add in your chicken pieces and fry for 6-8 minutes to cook the out of the chicken slightly and take on the spices. </li>
        <li>Add the cut up tomatoes and bell pepper. </li>
        <li>Add in your water, along with some salt. Place on a medium to high heat, place a lid on top and leave to bubble away for 20 minutes, until your chicken is cooked through. </li>
        <li>Once cooked, add in your washed rice and reduce the temperature to the lowest setting, place a teacloth around your saucepan lid and place on top - this will help create more steam and make your rice extra fluffy. This will need about 20 minutes to cook. </li>
        <li>In the meantime toast your almonds in a pan till they are golden. </li>
        <li>Once your rice is cooked, you are ready to serve up with a sprinkle of almonds, coriander and poms!</li>
        <li>ENJOY!</li>
    </ol>
