    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rolled oats, milk or water and salt are really all you need to make oatmeal, but I love adding a little cinnamon and vanilla to my base recipe. The oats turn out absolutely delicious and have the perfect consistency.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>old fashioned rolled oats</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Toppings </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add rolled oats, water or milk and a dash of salt to a pot and heat over medium/high heat. </li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat and cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Itâ€™s ready when the oats have soaked up most of the liquid and are nice and creamy. Transfer oats to a bowl and add your favorite toppings.  </li>
        <li>ENJOY!</li>
    </ol>
